# Library Organizer

## About

Library Organizer is a complete suite of tools designed to help users manage their personal or professional libraries. It hosts a variety of features:

* Create and assign books to one or more libraries
* Grant other users permission to edit, check out from, or view your libraries
* View a filtered list of books from viewable libraries
* Add or edit books from scratch, from existing books, or from isbn
* View a physical model of each library based on bookcase and book dimensions
* Organize books based on title, series, or dewey number
* View various statistics that describe one or more libraries
* Keep track of non-owned books as a wishlist

In this document, you will find both a user guide, for normal users to learn the software, and a REST API, for developers to utilize.

## Editing a Library

There are three types of information that can be edited for a library: The cases, breaks, and details.

* Managing Cases
* Managing Breaks
* Managing Library Details

### Managing Cases

A library is made of book cases. Each book case has the following fields that may be edited. See the Value Types section for more details.

Field | Value Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
Case Width | Positive Integer | This is the width of the shelf from end to end, not including the sides (so, from inside edge to inside edge)
Number of Shelves | Positive Integer | The number of shelves on this case. This is the number of locations that books may be placed, so it should include the bottom of the case.
Padding Left/Right | Positive Integer | This is the minimum amount of space that should be left on either side of a shelf to make up for measurements that were too small. The more accurate that you are in your measurements, the less padding that is needed.
Shelf Height | Positive Integer | The height, from the top of one shelf to the bottom of the next, of a shelf gap. This does not include the actual shelf height.
Spacer Size | Positive Integer | The thickness of the sides/shelves of a case. This is how thick the "outline" of the case and its shelves will be.

Cases may also be moved up or down by using the respective buttons, or deleted using the trash button of the corresponding case. To add a new shelf, click the plus button at the bottom of the dialog.

### Managing Breaks

There are two types of breaks that a library may include:
* Shelf Breaks - After a shelf break, books stop being put on the shelf the corresponding book is on and start again on the next shelf.
* Case Breaks - After a case break, books stop being put on the case the corresponding book is on and start again on the next case.

In addition to these types of breaks, breaks can be of a specific value type:
* Book - The break happens after a specific book
* Dewey - The break happens after the last book of a specific dewey
* Lexile - The break happens after the last book of a specific lexile
* Series - The break happens after the last book of a specific series
* Author - The break happens after the last book in each string of books by a specific author
* Title - The break happens after the last book whose title begins with a specific set of letters

To add a break, press the plus button at the bottom of the dialog. To remove a break, press the trash can on the corresponding break.

### Managing Details

There are two other features of a library that may be edited:

* Series - Choose series that have multiple authors, that should be sorted on their volumes first rather than their authors. For instance, normally if two books in a series have different authors, they will be sorted on their authors. If a series is on this list, however, it will be sorted by its volume instead.
* Sort Method - How this library should be primarily sorted. One of "Title", "Dewey", "Lexile", "Series", or "Author"

## Viewing Statistics

The statistics menu can be accessed by clicking the third button on the top of the screen. To change which libraries are being used to calculate the statistics, click the filter button in the top left of the screen. Only owned books are used in the calculations. There are several types of statistics, grouped into various categories:

* General - Information on books
  * Counts - Number of books that are read, reference, shipping, loaned, or being read
  * Size - Volume that is read, reference, shipping, loaned, or being read
  * Pages - Number of pages that are read, reference, shipping, loaned, or being read
* Publishers - Information on publishers and publication locations
  * Parent Company - Number of books published by each parent company
  * Top Publishers - Number of books published by the top publishers
  * Top Locations - Number of books published in the top locations
* Series - Number of books in each series
* Language - Information on languages
  * Primary Languages - Number of books written primarily in each language
  * Secondary Languages - Number of books written secondarily in each language
  * Original Languages - Number of books written originally in each language
* Deweys - Number of books in each overall dewey genre
* Formats - Number of books with each binding type
* Contributors - Information on contributors and roles
  * Top Contributors - Number of books written by the top contributors
  * Roles - Number of contributors with each role
* Dates - Information on publication dates
  * Original Publication Date - Number of books originally published in each decade
  * Edition Publication Date - Number of books whose edition was published in each decade

  * Volume - Total volume of the books

  * Depth - Total, average, minimum, and maximum depths of the books
  * Weight - Total, average, minimum, and maximum weights of the books
  * Pages - Total, average, minimum, and maximum pages of the books
* Lexiles - Number of books in each lexile grade level

## Value Types

There are several fields that require a specific value type. The different value types are described here:

* String - A generic text field
* Number - A positive or negative number, or zero
* Positive Integer - The field must be an integer that is greater than zero
* Non-Negative Integer - The field must be an integer that is at least zero
* Positive Number - The field must be an number that is greater than zero
* Non-Negative Number - The field must be an number that is at least zero
* ISBN - The field must be a valid isbn-10 or -13
* Dewey - The field must be a valid dewey decimal number (of the form "#[.#]" where the number on the left has three digits and the optional number after the decimal can contain any number greater than one of digits) or "FIC"
* Lexile - The field must be a valid lexile number (of the form "[BR]#L", where BR is optional and the number can contain any number of digits). Note that if a lexile begins with BR is means it is negative, so the BR100L is the integer equivalent of -100.
* Year - The field must be a four digit year
